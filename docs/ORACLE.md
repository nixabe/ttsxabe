# The PyTorch oracle

## 1. Provenance

The reference is 🤗 Transformers' `VitsModel`
(`transformers/models/vits/modeling_vits.py`), running `facebook/mms-tts-nan`
on CPU in float32. It is the definition of correct for this project. Where this
implementation and the reference disagree, the reference is right until proven
otherwise in writing.

Version matters: record the `transformers` version in the capture manifest. The
VITS implementation has changed shape before.

## 2. Why captured, not described

Expected values are **captured as binary**, never hand-transcribed into a test.
Transcribed constants are a copy of what someone believed the model does, and
they rot silently. A capture is a copy of what it actually did.

This also makes the failure legible: when a differential test fails you can
bisect the *stage*, because every intermediate was captured, not just the
waveform.

## 3. What is captured

One record per stage of the inference path, for a fixed input and a fixed seed:

| tensor | shape | why it is a checkpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `input_ids` | `[1, T]` | tokenisation is part of the contract |
| `embed` | `[1, T, 192]` | isolates the embedding table read |
| `enc_out` | `[1, T, 192]` | the 6-layer text encoder, incl. relative attention |
| `m_p`, `logs_p` | `[1, 192, T]` | the projection split |
| `log_duration` | `[1, 1, T]` | stochastic duration predictor |
| `noise_dur`, `noise_prior` | — | the exact draws used, so sampling is reproducible |
| `attn` | `[1, 1, F, T]` | the expansion from symbols to frames |
| `z_p` | `[1, 192, F]` | prior after length regulation |
| `z` | `[1, 192, F]` | flow reversed — the most bug-prone stage |
| `waveform` | `[1, S]` | the whole thing |

Capturing `z_p` and `z` separately is deliberate: the flow is four coupling
blocks and a swapped half is invisible in the waveform but obvious here.

## 4. Format

A directory `.golden/<name>/` holding `manifest.json` and one `.bin` per tensor:
raw little-endian f32, C order, shape in the manifest. Same convention as
`xabe-st` reads, so the test harness needs no second parser.

`.golden/` is gitignored. It is regenerable and it is large.

## 5. Regenerating

```sh
python tools/oracle/capture.py --out .golden/base --seed 0 \
    --text "lí hó, kin-á-ji̍t thinn-khì chin hó."
```

The seed is part of the record, not a default. A capture whose seed is unknown
is not an oracle.

## 6. Fidelity limits

- **CPU float32 only.** The reference on GPU produces slightly different results;
  comparing against a GPU capture would fold PyTorch's kernel choices into our
  definition of correct.
- **The tokenizer is captured, not reimplemented from the vocab file.** It
  lowercases and drops out-of-vocabulary characters, and those rules are worth
  pinning rather than inferring.
- **Sampling is pinned by capturing the noise, not the seed alone.** Two RNG
  implementations agreeing on a seed is not something to assume across
  languages.

## 7. Things found that the docs do not say

- The vocabulary is **POJ**, not Tâi-lô — `c` and U+0358 are present, `ⁿ` is
  not. See [MODEL.md](MODEL.md); this was found by reading the vocabulary, and
  confirmed by round-tripping synthesised audio back through an ASR model.
- The model card's example text (`"some example text in the Chinese, Min Nan
  language"`) is a generic placeholder that produces nothing meaningful. It is
  not an indication of the expected input format.
- `posterior_encoder`, a fifth of the checkpoint, is never read at inference.
