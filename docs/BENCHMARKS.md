# Benchmarks

## Current standing

**There is no standing. Nothing in this repository synthesises audio yet.**

This section holds the current numbers and nothing else. When a measurement
supersedes a cell, replace the cell — never append a dated note, a before/after
delta, or an "improved from X" narrative. The change story belongs in the commit
message; durable reasoning belongs in WHY below, and measured rejections in
WHY NOT.

## The baseline to beat

Measured on the pipeline this project exists to replace, on the target hardware,
`facebook/mms-tts-nan` under PyTorch on one Quadro RTX 8000:

| input | wall clock |
| --- | --- |
| short clause (~7 syllables) | ~90 ms synthesis |
| whole `/tts` request, short | ~274 ms including translation |

For context, the alternative engine in that pipeline (Fun-CosyVoice3, 0.5 B,
24 kHz) takes ~820 ms on the same clause. This project targets the 36 M VITS
model, so ~90 ms is the number to beat, not 820 ms.

Comparisons must be against PyTorch's best settings on this card, not its
defaults. A ratio measured against a badly configured baseline is not a result.

## How to measure

- Release build, `cargo test --workspace --release` green first.
- Warm the model, then time N ≥ 20 synthesis calls, report the **median** and
  the spread.
- Alternate implementations in pairs rather than running all of A then all of B.
  This card thermally drifts, and a 5% difference measured back-to-back is
  indistinguishable from drift measured in blocks.
- State the utterance length. Synthesis time scales with output frames, so a
  number without its input is not a number.

## Correctness gates

No performance number is admissible unless `cargo test --workspace --release` is
green on the same commit. A fast wrong kernel is not a result; see
[TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

# WHY

Durable reasoning. Things learned that outlive the change that taught them.

## The vocabulary is POJ, and getting that wrong is inaudible to the author

`facebook/mms-tts-nan` has `c` and U+0358 in its 48 symbols, which makes it POJ,
not Tâi-lô. Converting POJ to Tâi-lô before synthesis moves the text out of
distribution: on a sentence differing only in `chin`/`tsin`, ASR read the POJ
version back as 你好 今天天氣很好 and the Tâi-lô version as B號今天登記正好.

The general lesson: **the round trip through an ASR model is a usable objective
metric for TTS correctness** when you cannot evaluate the output language by
ear. It is not a substitute for a differential test, but it catches whole
classes of orthography and prosody bugs that no unit test would.

## A fifth of the checkpoint is never read

`posterior_encoder` (100 tensors, 7.24 M parameters) exists for training. Load
time and VRAM budgets should be computed on the inference subset.

# WHY NOT

Measured rejections. Each entry saves someone the same week.

## fp16 on the flow/decoder — rejected in the reference implementation

Not yet measured for this implementation, but the neighbouring engine in the
same pipeline (Fun-CosyVoice3) was measurably **slower** with `fp16=True` on
these cards: 3.48 s vs 2.27 s on a short utterance, 7.56 s vs 5.61 s on a longer
one. Turing has fp16 tensor cores but the cast overhead dominates when the
kernels are memory-bound.

Do not assume fp16 is free here. Measure it, and expect it to lose.
